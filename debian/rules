# Unfortunately, python-build's testsuite relies heavily on "pip
# install" and other network-related operations, which are not
# allowed during build time.
#
# Although not all tests are affected by this, it is becoming more and
# more difficult to maintain a list of tests that should be disabled
# because of this issue.  For this reason, and in order to keep the
# maintenance burden low, we decided to disable running these tests
# during build time.
#
# TODO: Create a dep8 test that runs the entire upstream testsuite.
